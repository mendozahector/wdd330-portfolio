    <h2>Notes/Questions</h2>
    <h3>Object methods, "this"</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
      <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
      <li>Methods can reference the object as this.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The value of this is defined at run-time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.</li>
      <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
      <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      * Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.
